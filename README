RUBY WARRIOR

This is a game designed to teach the Ruby language and artificial intelligence in a fun, interactive way.

You play as a warrior climbing a tall tower to reach the precious Ruby at the top level. On each floor, you need to write a Ruby script to instruct the warrior how to get to the stairs. You have some idea of what each floor contains, but you never know for sure how the obstacles are laid out and what will happen. You must give the Warrior enough artificial intelligence to find his own way.
