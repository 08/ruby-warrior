Primary
- add level 7 with pivot

Abilities
- add light ability
- add listen ability
- add throw ability

Secondary
- improve profile selection so it's harder to make a profile on the same tower
- use proxy whenever sending space to Player to avoid hacking
- handle errors cleanly stating if it's in the user's Player script
- add a more in-depth help doc if they get stuck

Ideas
- invalidate old player.rb when generating a new level so they don't accidentally edit that one.
- some actions take multiple turns (such as swinging a large axe) other units may be able to detect this and get out of the way
- units turns are taken in the order of their speed attribute
- add taunt ability to force other units to walk towards you
- reward remembering state between turns - such as where an enemy is, what he is doing, what his stats are, etc.
- after climbing the tower, re-run the last script on all levels
