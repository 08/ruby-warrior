Primary
- rename tower to dungeon
- improve profile selection so you don't replace your current tower profile
- add level with light and look abilities

Secondary
- use proxy whenever sending space to Player to avoid hacking
- add a more in-depth help doc if they get stuck
- hard wrap long descriptions/tips

Ideas
- invalidate old player.rb when generating a new level so they don't accidentally edit that one.
- some actions take multiple turns (such as swinging a large axe) other units may be able to detect this and get out of the way
- add taunt ability to force other units to walk towards you
- after climbing the tower, re-run the last script on all levels
- attacking or looking backward should be less effective than forward/left/right
- handle errors cleanly stating if it's in the user's Player script
- rename towers to more creative names
