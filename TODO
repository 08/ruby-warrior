Primary
- add enemy units which have scripts like the warrior
- add attack action
- add feel sense to detect if there's something near
- fill level readme adding more info about available abilities and units on level
- add wall boundaries so player can't move outside them
- add more generic documentation for those just getting started


Secondary
- use proxy whenever sending unit to Player to avoid hacking
- handle errors cleanly stating if it's in the user's Player script
- add a more in-depth help doc if they get stuck


Ideas
- the ability to pick up and equip items
- remember state across levels to keep score, health, etc.
- some actions take multiple turns (such as swinging a large axe) other units may be able to detect this and get out of the way
- units turns are taken in the order of their speed attribute
- add taunt ability to force other units to walk towards you
- reward remembering state between turns - such as where an enemy is, what he is doing, what his stats are, etc.
- pick up items on fallen enemy ?
